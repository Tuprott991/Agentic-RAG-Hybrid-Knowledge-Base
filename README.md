# Agentic RAG 2.0 Testing Phase 1 for T&C + things to note document

As research, to solve the problem, I would built my system with:
- Pydatic AI: AI Agent Framework (lightweight and less layer than langchain, I guess)
- Graphiti: Building knowledge graph (fast & accruate graph retrieve, also can custom define the graph Ontology)
